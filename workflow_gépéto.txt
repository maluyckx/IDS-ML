1) Understanding and Exploring the Data
    Data Loading: Load the labeled datasets.
    Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Explore the patterns in the datasets. Some tasks could be:
        Distribution of the number of requests per host.
        Frequency distribution of different types of DNS requests.
        Temporal patterns, e.g., distribution of requests over time.

2) Data Pre-processing
    Feature Engineering: Based on the EDA findings, create new features that might be relevant for classification. For example:
        Number of unique domain requests by a host.
        Ratio of requests to unique domains.
        Frequency of repeated requests in a short time frame.
        Temporal behavior, e.g., making requests during unusual hours.
    Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, outliers, etc.
    Scaling and Normalization: Ensure the data is on a comparable scale.

3) Model Selection
    Baseline Model: Start with a simple model (e.g., Logistic Regression) to set a baseline.
    Advanced Models: Consider models like Random Forest, Gradient Boosted Trees, Neural Networks, and SVM.
    Hyperparameter Tuning: Use methods like grid search or random search to find the best hyperparameters.
    
4) Training and Validation
    Splitting the Data: Separate the data into training, validation, and test sets. Cross-validation can also be used.
    Model Training: Train the selected models using the training dataset.
    Model Evaluation: Validate the models on the validation set using appropriate metrics (accuracy, F1-score, ROC-AUC, etc.).
